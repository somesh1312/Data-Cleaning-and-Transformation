Welcome to the Data Cleaning and Transformation Project! This project is a comprehensive exploration of data cleaning and transformation techniques. The main focus is on preparing datasets for analysis by addressing issues related to cleanliness, consistency, and structure.

Data Cleaning:
The primary objective of this project is to ensure the quality and integrity of the dataset. The data cleaning process involves:

Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Addressing outliers
Correcting inconsistent data
Standardizing formats

Data Transformation:
Data transformation is a crucial step in shaping the data to meet the requirements of downstream analyses. Key aspects of data transformation include:

Feature engineering
Encoding categorical variables
Scaling and normalization
Handling datetime objects
Creating derived variables

Acknowledgments
This project leverages various data cleaning and transformation techniques inspired by industry best practices and data science literature.
